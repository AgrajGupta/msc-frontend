Hi, this is Agraj Gupta.
I have searched some templates for the website and have come up with the following:
1. For the page listing the MSC team and contributors, I likes the template 'Team'.
'Team_2' is an alternative for "team' although I like 'Team' much more.
2.I liked the layut and interactive popups of the "gallery' tamplate as it is very awesome according to me, and we can
make use of it in the Gallery section of our page.
3. For the home page, I really like the transitionds in "Home_2'. I was thinking of picking up the transistions fron
'Home_2" and use it in "home'(which we use as a base), which looks preety elegant yet simple to me.

That's all I have for now.. Thanks
